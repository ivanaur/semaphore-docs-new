Semaphore features a chat notification system that lets you receive status
update messages directly in [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/),
[Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/), [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/),
and [Slack](https://slack.com/).

## Finding tokens

For Slack, within a chat room open the cog ("Change settings") > "Add an app
or integration". Search for "Semaphore", select a channel and you'll reach
instructions and integration settings, as below.

Copy the webhook URL, save the integration and open return to Semaphore.

For Hipchat, see a separate [guide for finding the right token](/docs/finding-hipchat-token.html).

## Setting up notifications on Semaphore

Head over to your project settings, click on the
**Notifications** tab, and choose your service. The screenshots feature Slack
settings, but the build and deploy forms are identical across all services.

Note that notifications can only be set up and modified by users who have admin
access to a project.

## Modifying notification policies

For both builds and deploys, Semaphore offers several filters to better control
what information you're subscribed to:

- **Always** — Notify after every build or deploy.
- **Never** — Do not notify after any build or deploy.
- **Failed only** — Notify only if the build or deploy fails (or is stopped
manually).
- **Change status** (applies to builds only) — Notify only the build breaks,
continues to fail, or has been fixed.

### Choosing for which branches build notifications are sent

Specifically for builds, you may choose to only receive notifications for a
certain subset of branches. You can do this by selecting **From whitelist** in
the **Select branches** dropdown box. A whitelist will appear, accepting [Ruby
regular expressions](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Regexp.html). Each line
specifies a branch name pattern for which notifications will be sent.

If you want to match exactly one specific branch, use exact pattern matching like `^production$`.

### Choosing for which servers deploy notifications are sent

If your project has deployment set up, a deploy section will appear in your chat
notification settings, along with a checkbox list of configured servers. Untick
any servers for which you do not wish to receive deploy notifications.

Save your settings, and you're done!

Happy building!
